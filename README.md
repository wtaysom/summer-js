It's summer 2011, and we're learning JavaScript, Canvas, and whatever else we need to chart system statistics from the Linux /proc directory.  This repo tracks our code, records our progress, and collects our links to resources (tools, training, tutorials, reference, libraries).

We use [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) as our primary text, [Singpath](http://www.singpath.com/) for some basic exercises, [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) as our editor, [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/make/download-mac.html?brand=CHKZ) as our browser, and [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for version control.
