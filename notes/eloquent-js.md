Notes for [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

# 1. Introduction

## Master Material

> Only continue on when you are reasonably sure you understand the material that came before.

## Punched Cards

> To program early computers, it was necessary to set large arrays of switches in the right position, or punch holes in strips of cardboard and feed them to the computer.

Early computers like the [IBM 1620](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620).

Punch holes in [punched cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card).

## ECMAScript

> You should not worry too much about these new versions [of JavaScript such has ECMAScript 5 and ECMAScript harmony] making the things you learn from this book obsolete.

Yeah, don't worry about them one bit.

## Remember to shift+click

> By holding the shift key while pressing the 'run' arrow on a block of code, all blocks before that one will be run as well, so when you start in the middle of a chapter, hold shift the first time you run a piece of code, and everything should work as expected.
