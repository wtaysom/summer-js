## Syntax Errors

> When writing for the computer, it is very common to make a trivial, superficial syntax mistakes in the code.

Absolutely true.  Happens everyday.

# [Digital Images](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs101/digital-images.html)

## Think Outside the Box

* What happens when `x` in `im.getPixel(x, y)` is too big?
* What happens when `y` in `im.getPixel(x, y)` is not a number?
* What happens when you try to `print` an image?

# [For Loop 1d](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs101/for-loop-1d.html)

## `++i`

I like to put my pluses first in `for` loops:

	for (x = 0; x < 20; ++x) { ... }

It's a signature style, a tribute to my dad who does it the same way.

I've actually caved to tradition and write it for (x = 0; x < 20; x++) { . . . }
